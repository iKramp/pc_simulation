# pc_simulation

Simulates a logic circut.
For now you have to start it through an ide or terminal to get component names in console (no UI yet). 
Switch components with +/- on keyboard, zoom with +/- on numpad, draw with left click and erase with right click. shift + left click is selection (copy), ctrl + v is paste
Space to go into simulation mode where you can click on latches to turn them on/off

#ALSO CHANGE THE PATH IN canvas_save() AND canvas_load() FUNCTIONS
